What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?

When we initialize the repository, it creates a .git file which is hidden. We need to initialize it in order to track the changes that are happening.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a middle ground or a hidden layer where we transfer the files to work on. In the staging area, we can make commits which would be quite helpful in coding.
