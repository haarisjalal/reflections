When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	We will do this once there are a numbr of people working together on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	This is because sometimes while working on the code, we do not want an unfinished code to be updated automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks: One copies from someone else github to your own. Refers to the original persons work.
	clones: copying it from one repository to another directly.
	branches: part of a single repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	If we have it stored locally, it is kind of a fall back plan.
