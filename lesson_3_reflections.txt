When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	We will do this once there are a numbr of people working together on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	This is because sometimes while working on the code, we do not want an unfinished code to be updated automatically.
